TODO list
1. unify form of sample function in On-policy worker and Off-policy worker
2. add postprocessor module to deal with different calculation using samples (from worker or buffer), e.g.
   advantage function, td-lambda, importance weights, etc, which can be used in different algorithms
3. add gradient clip (norm)
4. add readme
5. cleaning code to make it easier to understand and use
6. more test for debug
